Abstract
Olfactory communication is widespread in mammals, whereby odorants produced by the body may communicate territorial boundaries, reproductive status, and/or social dominance. These chemical cues can be accompanied by distinctive olfactory behaviors, such as urine washing (UW), where urine is deposited onto the hands and feet and transferred to substrates as animals move throughout their environment. Here, we combine behavioral and chemical data to assess the potential role of urine in communicating dominance status in male white-faced capuchins (Cebus imitator). We predicted that: 1) UW is more frequent in alpha than subordinate males, and 2) the chemical profile of alpha male urine is distinct from that of  subordinate males. We recorded all occurrences of UW during 358 hours of focal behavioral follows and collected 147 urine samples from 21 male capuchins in five social groups at Sector Santa Rosa, Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We extracted urinary volatile compounds in situ into thermal desorption tubes, which we analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that alpha males engaged in more UW than subordinate males. We observed differences across urine chemical profiles, yet these were not explained by male dominance status. We discuss the many potential environmental, physiological and social variables that may influence the chemical composition of urine, and suggest avenues of potentially fruitful future research on primate olfactory communication.

Keywords. Urine washing, olfactory communication, chemosignalling, volatile organic compounds, male dominance status, primates.
